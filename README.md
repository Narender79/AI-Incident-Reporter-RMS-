# AI-Incident-Reporter-RMS-
My AI Incident Reporter (RMS) enables users to safely report issues like AI harassment. Reports are securely routed via a Spring Boot backend to affiliated vendors, who use JWT authentication to log in, respond, and track incidents. This ensures direct accountability and transparent resolution on a secure, scalable platform.
